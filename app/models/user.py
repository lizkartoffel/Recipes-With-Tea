# regular foreign keys make a new colum in the DB 
# this doesnt tell swlmodel how this table connects to others 
# unlike Relationship which links them, creates virtual Python attributes that link models together. 
# and makes navigation easier

# recipes
# The attribute name on the User model.
# In Python code you will access user.recipes to get that user’s recipes.

# List["Recipe"]
# this attribute holds a list / collection of things.
# ["Recipe"] is a forward reference (string) to the Recipe class. We use a string because Recipe might be defined later in the file or another module.
# Together List["Recipe"] tells the editor/type-checker and SQLModel that recipes is a collection of Recipe objects (one-to-many).

# back_populates="author"
# names the attribute on the other model that “points back” to this model.
# In this example, it assumes your Recipe model has an attribute named author defined like:
# author: "User" = Relationship(back_populates="recipes")
# user_id: int = Field(foreign_key="user.id")
# back_populates makes the relationship bidirectional — you can do user.recipes and recipe.author and SQLAlchemy will keep both sides in sync.
